            <p>Hello people. This is the first post on my new website, 
                and I will use it to announce that the beta stages of the Consequence will conclude.</p>

            <p>I am basing my content on a set of problems that I did not think of, 
                but rather someone else’s. The terms were that the solutions of the first hundreds of problems can be public, 
                but not the rest. That is fine, considering that the flow of my videos is slow enough to provide for around 2 to 4 years, if this goes on, that is. 
                There’s also a trend that my video’s view count is decrease, and I can see why. People don’t just do math for recreational value; 
                they do other interesting things.</p>
            
            <p>I have not found my target audience, and I don’t know if I would.
                I am trying to move the project to a more casual approach where someone can still understand but can be entertained. 
                The people that I surround myself were first approached with a story, so why not go back with that strategy?</p>

            <p>The story strategy might work, but I would need time to execute it. 
                It is hard to tie a story to solving math. How is that supposed to work without looking “nerdy”? 
                I’ll just go with it. Plus, this isn’t my only project that has a “developing” story.</p>

            <p>So yes. The Consequence could probably go through some kind of arc, 
                but I am not final with it. I’ll be transparent about production; 
                the next video hasn’t been processed yet. I don’t know if I’m just taking my time or just procrastinating, 
                but I should get to work.</p>
            
            <p>Until then, I will figure things out. Perhaps further explanation 
                to those who don’t get it and would be interested to know will be put here. I connected the webpages to 
                MathJax so my websites can display math. </p>
            
            <p>See you.</p>
