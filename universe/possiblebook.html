            <p>Hi. I know I already made a post today, but I should also update you on the “Barry Acorps” universe. 
                I already have an idea for a book series.</p>
            
            <figure class="sideimage">

            </figure>

            <p>This book series is going to focus on a detective character that I recently made. She’s inspired by a lot of characters, mostly smart characters.
                I always wanted to write a book with a smart character doing their own smart things. 
                The only problem is how I would find the target audience.</p>

            
            <p>There’s probably a lot of mystery novels out there, and I don’t know how I would stand out.
                I haven’t heard a lot of mystery novels, so it’s either that there’s a lot of space in the mystery genre,
                or that a lot of mystery books just don’t get popular. Thinking that I won’t stand out won’t do anything,
                though I’ll just try to figure it out while I’m writing.</p>

            <p>I been talking a lot, so I’ll just minimize it to my ideas. 
                It’s written in a third person view (I might change it though), and it’s in the perspective of another character that is also recently made.
                Fun fact: If you know one of my characters already, they are the son of that character. I won’t reveal it though, but I think some of you might have an idea. </p>

            <p>The setting is 2010, and they are 14-year-olds attending a middle school. The first case happens in said middle school, but the rest is undecided.
                 The first book is going to be a 5-case book with around a hundred thousand words. 
                 Every case is going to be released 3 months from each other so I have enough time. The reason why I said it’s a book series is because I plan for it to have sequels,
                  written when they are a different age. A book corresponds to how old the detective character is.</p>
            
            <p>Though, this is all just ideas. None of this is final because I am constantly improving it. I will update you more on this website.</p>
            
            <p>See you.</p>
